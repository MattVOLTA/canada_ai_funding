## **Executive Summary: The Strategic Imperative and Funding Shift in Canadian AI Policy**

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Canadian Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) is a critical national economic challenge. Despite evidence that AI integration yields significant "tangible benefits"—with a Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) survey reporting success in 97% of adopting SMEs—Canada suffers from a widespread "imagination gap." Only 12% of Canadian firms have integrated AI into their operations, ranking the country among the lowest in AI adoption across the OECD.1 This low rate of adoption highlights a structural dependency on government support to bridge the knowledge and capital chasm.

The current federal funding architecture reflects a strategic pivot away from generalized digital literacy toward supporting high-value AI scaling and deep research and development (R\&D). The most significant development is the closure of the primary federal mechanism for general digital strategy funding. Consequently, the funding landscape is defined by three strategic factors:

1. **Shift to Compute Infrastructure (ACAF):** Federal funding is now dominated by the **AI Compute Access Fund (ACAF)**, targeting capital-intensive projects requiring eligible compute costs between $100,000 and $5,000,000.2 This program focuses explicitly on scaling and commercialization, requiring a high level of technological and financial maturity (minimum Series A financing).2  
2. **Focus on Deep R\&D (NRC IRAP):** Novel AI technology development, including Generative AI and Deep Learning solutions, is primarily channeled through the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP), particularly its specialized **AI Assist** stream.3  
3. **Regionalization of Foundational Adoption:** The termination of the Canada Digital Adoption Program (CDAP) for new applicants necessitates that SMEs aggressively pursue smaller, regional, and provincial grants (such as the Ontario Centre of Innovation’s DMAP or Nova Scotia’s DAP) to fund initial planning and low-cost adoption projects.4

Corporate strategy must therefore focus on correctly classifying the AI project—whether it is *adoption* (implementing existing technology) or *R\&D* (creating new knowledge/models)—to secure the appropriate, often highly technical, funding stream while adhering to complex compliance regulations, particularly the 75% stacking limit for total government assistance.7

## **Section 1: Federal Pillars of AI Innovation – Compute and R\&D**

Federal support for AI is concentrated in two primary programs designed to enhance Canada’s innovation performance and global competitiveness: the AI Compute Access Fund (ACAF) for commercial scaling and NRC IRAP for technological research and development.

### **1.1. The AI Compute Access Fund (ACAF) – Scaling and Commercialization**

Administered by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), ACAF is central to the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy. It provides essential financial support to mitigate the costliest component in the AI innovation value chain: access to powerful computational resources.2

#### **1.1.1. Eligibility Criteria**

To qualify for funding under a potential new Call for Proposals (CFP), applicants must satisfy stringent criteria covering corporate structure, size, financial maturity, and project readiness.2

* **Applicant Status:** The applicant must be a Canadian-registered for-profit company actively developing AI products or services.2 Consortiums are permitted but must apply through one eligible corporation or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) designated as the project lead.2  
* **Size Limitation:** The company must have fewer than 500 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees.2  
* **Financial Capacity:** Applicants must demonstrate financial viability either by being revenue-generating **or** by demonstrating significant investor interest through a minimum of **Series A financing**.2  
* **Project Location and Scope:** ACAF requires the applicant to have a Canada-based R\&D team and commit to carrying out all project activities within Canada. Projects must involve the development of AI products or services and must be supported by a robust commercialization plan detailing key milestones, target customers, competitive advantages, and strategies for scaling the project.2  
* **Compute Prerequisites:** Documentation, such as contracts or invoices for compute services, must be either in place or in progress at the time of application. If the arrangement is merely in progress upon application submission, a finalized contract must be demonstrated before a Contribution Agreement (CA) can be signed.2  
* **Indigenous Business Exception:** Recognizing the diverse nature of Indigenous enterprises, businesses that are not formally incorporated may still be considered eligible if they are for-profit, at least 51% owned and controlled by Indigenous Peoples, groups, or organizations, and demonstrate clear benefits to Indigenous communities. These applicants must provide their Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) business number for review.2

#### **1.1.2. Funding Mechanism and Policy Mandate**

ACAF is structured to maximize the incentive for utilizing domestic infrastructure, tying financial support directly to Canada’s sovereign compute goals.

* **Financial Coverage Ratios:** The fund provides support for eligible compute costs ranging from **$100,000 up to $5,000,000** over a period extending up to March 31, 2028\.2 The support levels are differentiated based on the supplier's origin:  
  * **Canadian, Cloud-based AI Compute Services:** The program covers **two-thirds (67%)** of eligible costs.2  
  * **Non-Canadian, Cloud-based AI Compute Services:** The program covers **half (50%)** of eligible costs.2

This differential cost coverage is a critical element of the policy, directly creating a financial incentive for applicants to utilize Canadian cloud providers. By making non-Canadian compute usage 33% more expensive (in terms of the uncovered project cost for the SME), ACAF acts as a strategic lever to stimulate the growth and competitiveness of Canada's domestic AI cloud infrastructure sector.

* **Contribution Forms:** Funding is provided in one of three forms, determined during the assessment phase based on the project’s strategic alignment and risk profile:  
  * **Non-repayable funding:** Reserved for projects that demonstrate strong alignment with program objectives, deliver significant public benefits to Canada, and present a manageable risk profile.  
  * **Repayable funding:** Applied when a proposal is strong but does not demonstrate significant public benefits.  
  * **Conditionally repayable funding:** Allows for repayment to be waived if the recipient successfully achieves specific performance milestones, such as achieving commercialization, making significant intellectual property (IP) registrations in Canada, or maintaining defined public benefits.2

#### **1.1.3. Application Method and Status**

ACAF operates on a competitive basis with periodic Calls for Proposals (CFP). The most recent CFP closed on July 31, 2025\.2 The application process is rigorous and multi-staged:

1. **Step 1: Sign up:** Applicants must create an account and verify their identity via the My Canada Business Account portal.2  
2. **Step 2: Submit Statement of Interest (SOI):** The SOI must be submitted at least ten days before the close of the CFP. This initial submission requires basic business information, an overview of the project, the estimated annual compute cost, and the targeted industry. ISED evaluates the SOI to confirm basic eligibility and alignment, responding within five business days. Success in this stage is mandatory to proceed.2  
3. **Step 3: Full Application:** Invited applicants must submit a detailed proposal covering business background, comprehensive project scope and budget, market potential, commercialization readiness, team composition, and projected benefits to Canada. An in-depth due diligence assessment follows, reviewing factors such as management capability, financial capacity, technology readiness, and public benefits.2  
4. **Step 4: Implementation and Monitoring:** If selected, the applicant signs a formal Contribution Agreement (CA) outlining the unique terms of the funding. Cost claims commence only after the CA is finalized. Regular project check-ins and a final summary report are required.2

### **1.2. NRC IRAP and the AI Assist Program – Technology R\&D**

The National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP) is the foundational federal program for supporting technology-driven R\&D, innovation, and scale-up among Canadian SMEs.8 AI projects that focus on creating *new* or *improved* AI capabilities, rather than merely adopting existing solutions, are channeled here.

#### **1.2.1. Eligibility Criteria for NRC IRAP**

* **Applicant Status:** The company must be a for-profit SME incorporated and operating in Canada.9  
* **Size Limitation:** Must employ **500 or fewer** full-time equivalents (FTEs) in Canada.9  
* **Operational Capacity:** The business must be actively involved in R\&D and focused on developing and commercializing innovative, technology-driven products, services, or processes. Critically, the company must employ staff beyond the founders, including both technical and business personnel.9  
* **Project Scope:** Projects must be transformative and focus on scientific research, product development, or technological advancement, often involving significant capital, up to $10,000,000 for R\&D projects.8

#### **1.2.2. The AI Assist Program**

The AI Assist program represents NRC IRAP's specialized initiative to support innovative SMEs harnessing advanced computational technologies.

* **Core Focus:** AI Assist is specifically designed to support the challenges inherent in developing and adapting complex **generative AI (GenAI)** and **deep learning (DL)** solutions.3  
* **Activities Supported:** This includes funding for scientific research, product development, rigorous testing, and validation of AI technologies, enabling SMEs to integrate advanced GenAI and DL capabilities directly into their core products and services.3  
* **Support Structure:** The program provides strategic guidance, access to necessary knowledge, specialized computing resources, and essential AI tools through NRC IRAP’s extensive network of Industrial Technology Advisors (ITAs).3

#### **1.2.3. Application Method**

NRC IRAP operates on an advisory, relationship-based model, rather than a self-serve application form.

* **Procedure:** Prospective SMEs interested in AI Assist or general R\&D support must first **contact the NRC IRAP office** (toll-free at 1-877-994-4727) to determine baseline eligibility. This step leads to the assignment of an Industrial Technology Advisor (ITA).3  
* **ITA Role:** The assigned ITA is crucial, working directly with the SME to define the project scope, assess the technological innovation, develop a budget, and structure the project before formal funding application documents are submitted and approved. Existing IRAP clients are directed to contact their assigned ITA immediately for access to the AI Assist stream.3

## **Section 2: The Digital Adoption Gap and Transition**

The funding ecosystem for Canadian SME digital adoption underwent a significant transformation with the closure of the Canada Digital Adoption Program’s most impactful stream, creating a void in foundational support for enterprises seeking to implement initial AI strategies.

### **2.1. Status of the Canada Digital Adoption Program (CDAP)**

CDAP, administered by ISED, previously served as the primary, low-barrier federal on-ramp for SMEs seeking to enhance their digital capacity.

#### **2.1.1. Closure of the Boost Your Business Technology Stream**

The most relevant component for AI planning, the Boost Your Business Technology stream, is **no longer accepting new applications as of February 19, 2024**.6

* **Historical Funding Context:** This stream offered a non-repayable grant covering up to 90% of eligible project costs, with a maximum contribution of **$15,000**, specifically for developing a digital adoption plan (which often included AI strategy consultation).11  
* **Historical Loan Component:** Successful grant recipients were eligible to apply for a zero-interest loan administered by the BDC, offering up to **$100,000** over a 5-year term, with an additional 12 months of capital postponement (totaling 6 years) for implementation.6  
* **Historical Eligibility (For reference):** Eligibility required the business to be for-profit, registered or incorporated, have employed at least one person other than the owner, and recorded at least $30,000 in annual revenue in the most recent tax year.12  
* **Guidance for Legacy Applicants:** Only businesses that signed a valid grant agreement *before* the February 19, 2024, closing date remain eligible for the grant and the associated BDC loan, provided they adhere strictly to all predetermined program deadlines. Extensions are not permitted.6

#### **2.1.2. The Residual Grow Your Business Online Stream**

The alternative CDAP stream, Grow Your Business Online, remains operational but is limited in scope, focusing on foundational digital presence. This stream offers a maximum non-repayable grant of **$2,400** to support e-commerce solutions and basic online capabilities.11

### **2.2. Strategic Consequences of the CDAP Closure**

The elimination of the $15,000 Boost Your Business Technology planning grant has significant consequences for broader SME AI adoption.

The closure removes the subsidized mechanism previously available to SMEs to fund the essential external consultation required to overcome the "imagination gap".1 Without this low-cost federal grant, the initial financial risk associated with hiring a consultant to determine AI feasibility and implementation strategy is entirely transferred back to the SME. This shift significantly increases the initial capital barrier for businesses new to AI, which risks exacerbating Canada's already low technology adoption rates.

Furthermore, the BDC, which administered the zero-interest loan, has adapted its offerings. While the CDAP loan is closed to new applicants, BDC now explicitly promotes its **Data to AI Program** for expert guidance and preferential rate financing to facilitate transformation involving AI, automation, and cybersecurity.6 This signifies a transition where BDC is now offering specialized, internal financing products, requiring SMEs to secure support under commercial lending terms rather than relying on a government-subsidized facility.

## **Section 3: Regional and Provincial AI Adoption Initiatives**

With the reduction of federal support for general digital adoption, provincial and regional development agency programs have become essential components of an SME’s funding strategy, particularly for projects focusing on implementation rather than pure R\&D.

### **3.1. Ontario Centre of Innovation (OCI) – Digitalization Competence Centre (DCC)**

The OCI, in partnership with the provincial and federal governments, accelerates the commercialization and adoption of emerging technologies in Ontario.13

#### **3.1.1. Digital Modernization & Adoption Plan (DMAP)**

DMAP is the direct provincial analog to the defunct CDAP planning grant, specifically designed to help Ontario-based SMEs understand their digital needs.

* **Eligibility:** Must be an Ontario-based for-profit SME with between **1 and 499** employees.4  
* **Purpose:** Provides financial support to develop a custom Digital Modernization and Adoption Plan in collaboration with a Digital Adoption Consultant.4  
* **Funding:** The grant offers up to **$15,000** in support, covering up to **50%** of the eligible project costs.4  
* **Application Method:** Applicants must initiate the process by submitting an **Interest Form** for the Digital Modernization program (DMAP) and Technology Demonstration Program (TDP).4 Note the crucial restriction that applicants may only apply to DMAP or the Retail Modernization Project Grant (RMPG), but not both.4

#### **3.1.2. Technology Demonstration Program (TDP)**

The TDP supports the actual implementation phase of digital technologies identified in the planning stage.

* **Purpose:** Supports Ontario SMEs in adopting and implementing digital technologies, which can include the integration of AI solutions.14  
* **Funding:** Offers up to **$150,000** in reimbursement funds, covering a maximum of **50%** of the project costs.14

### **3.2. British Columbia – Regional Artificial Intelligence Initiative (RAII)**

The RAII is jointly promoted by the Government of British Columbia and PacifiCan, the federal economic development agency for the region.15 This program is distinctly focused on large-scale, high-impact AI projects.

* **Eligibility:** Incorporated businesses and not-for-profit organizations.15 Specific eligibility requirements are detailed on PacifiCan’s website.  
* **Project Objectives:** Projects must focus on commercializing or adopting AI solutions in B.C. and must use AI to improve specific outcomes, including human health, environmental health, or economic resilience across key sectors (e.g., infrastructure, transportation).15  
* **Funding:** RAII offers exceptionally high funding caps:  
  * For incorporated businesses: Up to **$3,000,000** per project.15  
  * For not-for-profit organizations (supporting ecosystem development): Up to **$5,000,000** per project.15  
* **Application Status:** The initiative is open and continuous, but subject to specific intake deadlines (e.g., January 17, 2025, for projects starting in April 2025). Application details are maintained on PacifiCan's dedicated website.15

The high funding threshold of RAII ($3M-$5M) strategically directs capital toward a limited number of highly mature projects that can demonstrate strong, quantifiable economic and societal outcomes. This structure positions RAII as a scaling fund rather than an entry-level grant, underscoring the regional policy’s preference for accelerating proven technologies.

### **3.3. Quebec – Investissement Québec (IQ) Fonds Impulsion**

Investissement Québec (IQ) supports innovative Quebec businesses through specialized financing solutions. The Impulsion PME program has been replaced by the **Fonds Impulsion**.16

* **Financial Structure:** IQ’s approach is unique, focusing on investment in equity or quasi-equity forms, such as convertible debentures and Simple Agreements for Future Equity, instead of traditional grants.17 This funding is contingent upon matching investment amounts provided by recognized private investors.17  
* **Funding Limits:** IQ's investment cannot exceed **50% of the total financial package**.17  
  * Minimum investment: **$250,000**.17  
  * Maximum investment for general technology sectors: **$1,000,000** (or $750,000 for companies in the Montreal metropolitan area).17  
* **Admissible Projects:** Focuses on the development and commercialization of innovative products or services, with examples including the development of cutting-edge AI-driven medical devices.17

The IQ structure requires that Quebec-based AI firms must be positioned for venture capital, changing the financing dynamic from simple cost coverage to strategic partnership and, crucially, acceptance of a change in corporate governance or ownership through equity or quasi-equity financing.

### **3.4. Atlantic Canada Regional Support**

Support for technology adoption in Atlantic Canada is primarily driven by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), a federal development agency, and provincial programs.

* **ACOA Business Development Program (BDP):** ACOA's central mechanism provides interest-free repayable funding to help established businesses expand, improve productivity, develop new products, and hire expertise.18 AI adoption projects aimed at enhancing productivity are eligible under this general framework. Applicants apply for financial assistance directly through ACOA’s systems.18  
* **Nova Scotia Digital Adoption Program (NSBI DAP):** This program provides financial incentives for Nova Scotian businesses to adopt digital tools and innovations.  
  * **Criteria:** Must be a Nova Scotia registered business in good standing, with less than 100 FTEs in Nova Scotia, and a permanent establishment in the province. Eligibility historically required demonstrating a 30% revenue drop in April 2020 compared to April 2019\.5  
  * **Funding:** Contributes up to **50%** of eligible costs, to a maximum of **$10,000** CAD, with a minimum project cost of $2,000 CAD.5 DAP covers digital tools, including those used for automation and data analytics.20  
* **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The provincial government has invested significantly in AI training, aiming to build SME capability in strategy, human resources, finance, and marketing through focused training and capstone projects where participants develop AI-based solutions for business challenges.21

## **Section 4: Strategic Compliance and Leveraging Synergies**

For SMEs to successfully navigate Canada’s complex funding ecosystem, they must adhere to strict rules governing the combination of funds (stacking) and understand the retrospective cost recovery available through tax credits.

### **4.1. Navigating Funding Stacking Regulations**

Stacking involves securing more than one grant or loan to finance different phases or expense categories of a single project.22 While permitted, it is heavily regulated to ensure equitable distribution of public funds.

* **Maximum Government Contribution:** The overarching rule dictates that the total financial assistance received from all levels of Canadian government—federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal—must not exceed **75% of the total eligible project costs**.7  
* **Prohibition on Double Dipping:** A core constraint is the inability to claim the exact same expense item (e.g., a specific salary hour or compute bill) against two different funding sources.7 To comply, project budgets must be rigorously partitioned into well-organized sub-projects or phases that focus on separate activities and expenses.22  
* **Preferred Stacking Configuration:** Successful stacking strategies typically involve combining **one federal program** (like ACAF or NRC IRAP) with **one provincial program** (like OCI DMAP or NSBI DAP).7 Stacking two federal programs or two provincial programs is often disallowed unless distinct project scopes are maintained.22  
* **Mandatory Disclosure:** Applicants are obligated to identify and disclose all sources of funding from all levels of Canadian governments for every expenditure submitted in their application. Failure to disclose total government support may result in the rejection of the application, termination of an active project, or recovery of funds.23

The complex nature of federal regional development agencies (e.g., PacifiCan, ACOA) requires careful classification; although they operate regionally, their funding is technically federal. Therefore, an SME operating nationally must carefully segment project expenses geographically to prevent a conflict between two federal programs, such as an NRC IRAP salary claim and an ACOA BDP claim, for the same personnel or activity.

### **4.2. Leveraging the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR\&ED) Tax Credit**

The SR\&ED program is a crucial retrospective tax incentive that allows Canadian companies to recover costs associated with R\&D, including the development of complex AI algorithms and models.24

#### **4.2.1. AI Project Eligibility Criteria**

SR\&ED eligibility is determined by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) based on three fundamental scientific or technological criteria 24:

1. **Technological Uncertainty:** The project must be initiated to resolve a technical uncertainty that cannot be overcome using standard AI models, publicly available information, or recognized industry practices.24 This element confirms that the work involves genuine experimentation.  
2. **Systematic Investigation:** The R\&D work must demonstrate a structured and systematic approach, involving planned experimentation, hypothesis formulation, testing, and iterative improvement aimed at reducing the technological uncertainty.24 Both successful and unsuccessful projects are eligible, provided this systematic process was followed.25  
3. **Technological Advancement:** The outcome of the project must result in new knowledge, significantly improved AI capabilities, or innovative approaches. This may include new techniques in data handling, training processes, or unique algorithmic features.24

A critical distinction must be made between AI *adoption* (implementing an existing, off-the-shelf AI service) and AI *development* (creating or modifying core algorithms). Only projects that meet the R\&D criteria of creating new knowledge are eligible for SR\&ED.

#### **4.2.2. The Duality of R\&D Funding Narratives**

SMEs attempting to leverage both upfront grants (ACAF, NRC IRAP) and retrospective tax credits (SR\&ED) must manage inherently conflicting narratives. Upfront programs often favor proposals that demonstrate high commercial readiness and a low-to-moderate risk profile.2 Conversely, SR\&ED claims are justified by the existence of significant technological uncertainty and the risk of R\&D failure.24

To succeed in both avenues, corporate documentation must meticulously differentiate between commercial risk (which should be low for grant applications) and the underlying technological risk or uncertainty (which must be high for SR\&ED eligibility). The application process for SR\&ED involves submitting **CRA Form T661, Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR\&ED) Expenditures Claim**, along with the corporate income tax return, requiring comprehensive substantiation of the systematic investigative process and the technical advancements achieved.24

## **Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations**

The Canadian funding landscape for AI adoption by SMEs is characterized by a significant transition toward supporting high-value R\&D and compute-intensive commercialization, leaving a strategic gap in subsidized foundational planning support.

### **Strategic Pathway Mapping**

SMEs must first categorize their AI initiative to identify the correct funding pathway:

| Pathway Category | Program Examples | Primary Focus | Key Financial Thresholds |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **High-Volume R\&D & Compute** | ACAF (Federal), NRC IRAP (Federal) | Developing new AI technologies (GenAI, DL) or scaling compute infrastructure. | $\\ge \\$100,000$ in eligible compute costs (ACAF); 500 FTE maximum.2 |
| **Foundational Adoption & Planning** | OCI DMAP (Ontario), NSBI DAP (Nova Scotia) | Initial digital strategy consultation and low-cost implementation of existing AI tools. | $\\le \\$15,000$ (planning); 50% project cost coverage (DMAP).4 |
| **Retrospective R\&D Recovery** | SR\&ED Tax Credit (Federal) | Recovering salary and material costs related to documented technological research. | Requires proof of Technological Uncertainty and Systematic Investigation.24 |
| **High-Scale Regional Adoption** | BC RAII (PacifiCan) | Accelerating mature AI adoption with high economic, health, or environmental impact. | Up to $\\$3,000,000$ for businesses in British Columbia.15 |

### **Executive Action Plan**

Based on the current funding environment, the following actions are essential for optimizing funding capture:

1. **Prioritize ITA Engagement for R\&D:** For any project involving the development of novel AI models or overcoming inherent technological challenges, proactive engagement with an NRC IRAP Industrial Technology Advisor (ITA) is the mandatory first step, superseding any other application process.3  
2. **Strategic Compute Provider Selection:** Companies pursuing ACAF must ensure their projected compute budget meets the minimum $100,000 threshold and must strategically favor Canadian cloud providers to maximize the government’s cost contribution to two-thirds (67%) of eligible costs.2  
3. **Aggressive Pursuit of Provincial Planning Grants:** Given the closure of the federal CDAP planning grant, SMEs must immediately assess eligibility for provincial equivalents, such as OCI DMAP, to offset the crucial advisory phase costs.4  
4. **Implement Robust Compliance Accounting:** To avoid breaching the 75% total government contribution limit and violating the "no double dipping" rule, companies must establish rigorous internal accounting systems capable of partitioning expenses across different grant and tax credit claims with precision. This is especially critical when combining a federal R\&D program with a provincial adoption initiative.7  
5. **Maintain Dual R\&D Documentation:** Companies must develop a dual documentation system: one that emphasizes commercial viability and low risk for upfront grant applications (ACAF/IRAP) and a separate, detailed system that rigorously documents technological uncertainty, experimentation, and failure points to maximize retrospective SR\&ED recovery.24

The current policy posture requires SMEs seeking significant AI capital to demonstrate maturity and innovation capability far beyond basic digitalization. Enterprises must raise their internal technological competency and strategic funding expertise to compete effectively for the substantial capital now being directed towards Canada's AI innovation leaders.
