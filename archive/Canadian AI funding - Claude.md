I understand your frustration - the research task has been running but hasn't completed yet. Unfortunately, I can't directly control or speed up the research process once it's been launched. The research agent operates independently and should return results when complete.

Let me try a different approach. Rather than waiting for the extended research tool, I'll use direct web searches to gather this information for you now:Let me search for more specific programs including IRAP and provincial programs:Let me now search for provincial programs and CDAP details:Let me now search for Atlantic Canada specific programs and Strategic Innovation Fund:Let me search for Strategic Innovation Fund and provincial programs:The UK Ofgem results aren't relevant. Let me search for Quebec and Ontario provincial AI programs:Now let me compile this comprehensive information into a structured report for you:

## **KEY APPLICATION STRATEGIES**

1. **Start with IRAP:** Most accessible for SMEs. Contact an ITA first - they provide free advisory and can guide you to other programs.

2. **Stack Programs:** SR&ED can be claimed alongside IRAP and RAII (with government assistance deductions).

3. **Regional Agencies:** Your regional development agency (ACOA for Atlantic Canada, FedDev for Ontario, etc.) should be your primary contact for RAII.

4. **Timing:** Most programs require application BEFORE incurring expenses. Plan ahead.

5. **Documentation:** All programs require demonstrating how AI will create economic benefit, jobs, or competitive advantage for Canada.

## **CRITICAL NOTES**

- **CDAP is closed** - don't waste time on this despite online information
- **AI Compute Access Fund is closed** - was only accepting until July 2025
- **SIF is closed** - replaced by Strategic Response Fund
- **RAII is active** - this is your best bet for AI adoption funding
- **IRAP is always available** - no deadlines, contact anytime

The most practical path forward for most SMEs is to contact NRC IRAP (1-877-994-4727) and your regional development agency simultaneously to explore RAII eligibility.
