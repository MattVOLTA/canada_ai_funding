### Common IRAP Application Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Applying for Adoption (Not R&D):**
- IRAP is for developing NEW technology
- If you're just implementing existing software → NOT eligible
- If you're customizing/developing AI models → Eligible

**❌ Weak Technical Uncertainty:**
- "We're building a website with AI" → Too simple
- "We're developing novel ML algorithm for X that overcomes Y limitation" → Good

**❌ No Commercialization Plan:**
- "We'll figure out customers later" → Rejected
- "We have 3 LOIs from customers totaling $500K" → Strong

**❌ Unrealistic Budget or Timeline:**
- 6-month projects are often too short
- >24-month projects need strong justification
- Budget should match scope

**❌ Weak Team:**
- Founder with no technical experience → Problem
- Strong technical co-founder + advisor network → Better
- Prior exits or industry experience → Best

**❌ Not Talking to ITA Early:**
- Don't wait until you need money urgently
- ITAs can guide you before formal proposal
- Build relationship early

---

### Expected Timeline for IRAP

**Week 0:** Initial call to 1-877-994-4727
**Week 1:** Assigned to ITA
**Week 2:** ITA assessment meeting
**Weeks 3-4:** Develop proposal with ITA guidance
**Week 5:** Submit proposal
**Weeks 6-17:** Proposal review (up to 3 months)
**Week 18:** Funding decision
**Week 19:** Sign agreement
**Week 20:** Begin project, submit first expense claim

**Total timeline: 4-5 months from first call to funding**

**However:** Timeline varies significantly based on:
- ITA workload
- Proposal quality
- Technical complexity
- Budget size
