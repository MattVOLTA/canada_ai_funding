1. **Structured program reports** in `program_reports/` directory
2. **MongoDB database** with parsed, queryable data
3. **Automated research pipeline** using the funding-program-researcher skill

The information from these early research documents has been:
- ✅ Extracted and validated
- ✅ Structured into standardized markdown reports
- ✅ Imported into MongoDB for intelligent matching
- ✅ Made searchable through the database system

## When to Reference

These files may be useful for:
