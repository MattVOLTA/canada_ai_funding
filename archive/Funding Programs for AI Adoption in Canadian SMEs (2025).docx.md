# Funding Programs for AI Adoption in Canadian SMEs (2025)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a strategic priority across Canada, and governments have introduced numerous funding programs to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt and leverage AI technologies for growth. These programs take various forms – grants, non-repayable contributions, interest-free loans, and tax credits – and exist at both the national level and within every province and territory. Below is a comprehensive overview of current (as of late 2025\) funding initiatives explicitly focused on supporting AI adoption or development in SMEs. Each entry includes the program name, administering organization, funding type, a description of support, key eligibility criteria, application process, and any relevant deadlines or intake periods. A summary table is also provided for quick reference.

## National Programs Supporting AI Adoption

Canada’s federal government and national agencies offer several programs to encourage AI-related innovation and technology uptake by SMEs. These programs are generally available across all regions and sectors (some with specific focus areas) and are targeted to Canadian SMEs (typically defined as businesses with fewer than 500 employees). Key national programs include:

* **Regional Artificial Intelligence Initiative (RAII)** – *Administered by Canada’s Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)*. **Type:** Interest-free repayable contributions for businesses; non-repayable contributions for not-for-profits. **Description:** RAII is a **$200 million** federal initiative (Budget 2024\) to accelerate the development and adoption of AI across Canada[\[1\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=To%20stay%20at%20the%20forefront,clean%20technology%2C%20healthcare%20and%20manufacturing)[\[2\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=,workers%20with%20the%20right%20skills). Delivered through regional agencies (e.g. FedDev Ontario, PrairiesCan, ACOA, PacifiCan, CanNor, CED-Q), RAII supports two streams: **(1)** *AI productization and commercialization* – helping AI-focused start-ups and scale-ups bring new AI solutions to market; and **(2)** *Adoption of AI in key sectors* – helping SMEs in traditional industries integrate AI into their operations[\[2\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=,workers%20with%20the%20right%20skills). **Funding Details:** Projects can receive **$250,000 to $5 million** in contributions over up to 3 years[\[3\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=Available%20assistance). For-profit SMEs are eligible for **interest-free repayable funding up to 50%** of project costs[\[4\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=PrairiesCan%20contributions%20must%20range%20between,a%20maximum%20of%203%20years).

Application guides and regional office contacts are available on each RDA’s website[\[15\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/services/funding/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative.html#:~:text=,30).

* **AI Compute Access Fund** – *Administered by Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) as part of Canada’s AI Compute Strategy*. **Type:** Grant/Contribution. **Description:** Launched in mid-2025, this new fund helps SMEs access costly high-performance computing resources for AI projects. It is part of the **$2 billion Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy**, with **$300 million** earmarked for the AI Compute Access Fund[\[16\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=initiative%20to%20help%20SMEs%20advance,their%20AI%20capabilities)[\[17\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=Strategic%20Investment%20in%20Canada%E2%80%99s%20AI,Ecosystem). The program’s goal is to **level the playing field** by subsidizing cloud and supercomputing costs, enabling Canadian SMEs to train and deploy AI models that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive[\[18\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20,SMEs%20advance%20their%20AI%20capabilities)[\[19\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=This%20newly%20announced%20capital%20investment,the%20rapidly%20evolving%20AI%20landscape). **Funding Details:** SMEs can receive **$100,000 to $5 million** per project, covering up to **66%** of eligible costs for use of Canadian cloud or compute services (or 50% for non-Canadian cloud services)[\[20\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=support%20to%20eligible%20Canadian%20SMEs). Supported expenses include cloud computing fees and related costs to train, test, and deploy AI models[\[21\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=). Projects must require significant computing resources for AI development and aim to commercialize a made-in-Canada AI product or service[\[22\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=). **Eligibility:** Canadian for-profit SMEs (under 500 employees) that have a demonstrable AI product R\&D program, with either existing revenues or at least Series A funding, are eligible[\[23\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=%2A%20For,with%20a%20clear%20commercialization%20pathway). Applicants must have an in-Canada R\&D team and a clear commercialization plan for their AI solution[\[24\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=%2A%20For,with%20a%20clear%20commercialization%20pathway). Pure research or routine IT projects are ineligible – proposals should show how the computing power will drive innovation and productivity[\[25\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=,completed%20by%20March%2031%2C%202028)[\[26\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=,model%20training%2C%20testing%2C%20or%20deployment). **How to Apply:** The first call opened June 25, 2025, with a **statement of interest** phase, and full applications were due by **July 31, 2025**[\[27\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=). (Future intakes may be announced given the multi-year funding.) Applications are submitted through ISED’s portal and require details on the AI project’s goals, compute needs, and expected economic impact. Decisions consider alignment with Canada’s AI innovation goals and potential for productivity improvements[\[22\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=).

* **NRC IRAP (Industrial Research Assistance Program)** – *Administered by National Research Council Canada*. **Type:** Non-repayable contribution (grant) plus advisory support. **Description:** NRC IRAP is a long-running federal program that supports innovative R\&D by Canadian SMEs. While not AI-specific, IRAP frequently funds projects involving AI, machine learning, software development, and other technologies. It provides both technical advisory services and direct funding to help SMEs develop new products or processes. **Funding Details:** IRAP contributions typically cover **80% of salary costs and 50% of contractor costs** for an R\&D project[\[28\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,CNRC)[\[29\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,les%20entreprises%20tech%20et%20manufacturi%C3%A8res). There is no fixed maximum, but projects usually receive up to a few hundred thousand dollars in support, depending on scope. Funding is non-repayable. **Eligibility:** Canadian SMEs (generally \<500 employees) that are pursuing technology innovation with commercial potential can qualify. The project must involve significant technical uncertainty or innovation – e.g. developing a new AI-driven product or integrating AI into operations in a novel way. **How to Apply:** Companies engage with an IRAP Industrial Technology Advisor (ITA) in their region. The ITA assesses the project’s merits and guides the funding application. There is no deadline; IRAP accepts proposals year-round. Projects are evaluated on technical innovation and market potential. (Note: Due to demand, IRAP funding is competitive and subject to annual budget availability.)

* **Innovative Solutions Canada (ISC)** – *Administered by Innovation Canada (ISED) in collaboration with federal departments*. **Type:** Competitive innovation challenges – grant/contribution contracts. **Description:** ISC is a federal program that invites SMEs to propose innovative solutions to specific challenges identified by government departments. Many challenges relate to AI and data (e.g. AI for environmental monitoring, health diagnostics, etc.), making this a valuable avenue for AI-focused SMEs. **Funding Details:** ISC has two streams: **Challenge Stream** – where successful proposals get phased funding (typically **Phase 1 proof-of-concept grants around $150k**; Phase 2 prototype development grants up to $1 million); and **Testing Stream** – where federal departments purchase and test late-stage innovative prototypes from SMEs (contracts up to $500k or more). Funding is non-repayable and aimed at development/testing of the innovation. **Eligibility:** Only Canadian SMEs (for-profit, under 500 employees) can apply. Each challenge has specific requirements, but generally the SME must propose a novel solution (which could be an AI software, system or AI-enabled device) that meets the challenge criteria. **How to Apply:** Challenges are posted on the ISC website throughout the year. SMEs submit proposals for Phase 1 by the stated deadline for each challenge. Proposals are evaluated for novelty, feasibility, and potential to meet the government’s need. If selected, the SME receives a Phase 1 grant to develop proof of concept. Successful Phase 1 companies can then compete for Phase 2 funding. The Testing Stream requires having a market-ready innovation for government to test; applications are accepted on an ongoing basis for eligible innovations. Each challenge’s call document provides application instructions.

* **Canada Digital Adoption Program (CDAP)** – *Administered by ISED, delivered via partner organizations and the Business Development Bank of Canada*. **Type:** Grant (for advisory services) \+ interest-free loan (for implementation). **Description:** CDAP is a nationwide program (launched 2022\) to help SMEs adopt digital technologies, which can include AI solutions. It has two components: **“Grow Your Business Online”** – a micro-grant for very small businesses to set up e-commerce (less AI-relevant), and **“Boost Your Business Tech”** – targeted at SMEs to develop digital adoption plans and implement transformative technologies. The latter is most applicable to AI adoption for SMEs looking to integrate advanced software, automation, data analytics or AI into their operations. **Funding Details:** Under Boost Your Business Tech, eligible firms receive a **grant covering 90% of the cost (up to $15,000)** to hire a vetted digital advisor who will produce a Digital Adoption Plan[\[30\]](https://www.cdap-manitoba.ca/#:~:text=manitoba,your%20advisor%20consultation%20fee%2C). After developing the plan, the SME becomes eligible for a **BDC 0%-interest loan** of up to **$100,000** to finance the purchase and implementation of new technology solutions (repayable over several years). Additionally, CDAP offers placements for students or recent graduates to help with the digital projects. **Eligibility:** SMEs across Canada with between 1 and 499 employees and at least $500,000 in annual revenues in one of the previous three years can qualify for the Boost Your Business Tech stream[\[31\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/accelerate-ai-innovation-canada-ai-compute-access-fund/#:~:text=,help%20SMEs%20undertake%20technology%20innovation). The program is sector-agnostic. The loan approval (through BDC) is subject to credit evaluation. **How to Apply:** Applications are made through the Innovation Canada online portal. There is no firm deadline; intakes are open until the program’s funds are fully allocated (the overall program runs until 2026). Companies first fill out an online eligibility check, then are matched with a digital advisor. After the advisor completes the plan and the grant is disbursed, the SME can apply to BDC for the interest-free implementation loan.

* **BDC “Data to AI” Program** – *Administered by the Business Development Bank of Canada*. **Type:** Advisory services plus **financing (loan)**. **Description:** In late 2024, BDC launched the **Data to AI Program** to help demystify AI for SMEs and support them in modernizing operations through AI, automation, and data-driven decision-making[\[32\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=Montreal%2C%20December%204%2C%202024%20%E2%80%93,in%20an%20evolving%20business%20landscape)[\[33\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=The%20Data%20to%20AI%20Program,integrating%20AI%2C%20cybersecurity%2C%20and%20automation). The program combines expert advisory (assessments, training and a roadmap for AI adoption) with **preferential-rate financing** to implement the recommended AI and digital solutions[\[33\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=The%20Data%20to%20AI%20Program,integrating%20AI%2C%20cybersecurity%2C%20and%20automation)[\[34\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/consulting/data-ai-program#:~:text=,with%20financing). It emphasizes not just AI but also the supporting elements like data strategy and cybersecurity for a successful digital transformation[\[35\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=personalized%20advice%20to%20guide%20companies,integrating%20AI%2C%20cybersecurity%2C%20and%20automation). **Funding Details:** BDC provides a **term loan at a preferential interest rate**, with flexible repayment, to cover up to **100% of the project costs** for integrating AI, including consulting, software acquisition, equipment, and training[\[34\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/consulting/data-ai-program#:~:text=,with%20financing). Loans can have up to **8-year** terms with an initial payment deferral period[\[36\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/consulting/data-ai-program#:~:text=). The advisory portion yields a tailored AI adoption roadmap, and then the SME can access the financing to execute that plan[\[37\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=development%20of%20a%20detailed%20roadmap,integrating%20AI%2C%20cybersecurity%2C%20and%20automation)[\[38\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/mediaroom/news-releases/bdc-launches-data-ai-program-help-canadian-businesses-adopt-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-and-competitiveness#:~:text=The%20case%20of%20Vortex%20Aquatic,sales%20support). **Eligibility:** Canadian SMEs (clients or potential clients of BDC) in virtually any sector can use this program. The business must meet BDC’s standard lending criteria (creditworthiness, etc.) and be seeking to undertake a meaningful digital transformation involving AI, automation, or data analytics. **How to Apply:** Interested businesses can contact their BDC account manager or submit a request via BDC’s website[\[39\]](https://www.bdc.ca/en/consulting/data-ai-program#:~:text=1). BDC will discuss the company’s objectives and challenges, then if appropriate, engage the Data to AI advisory team. After an initial assessment, BDC and the company agree on a project scope. The company then works with BDC’s experts on the roadmap and applies for the loan. There is no fixed deadline; it’s an ongoing service offering.

* **Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF)** – *Administered by ISED*. **Type:** Larger-scale project funding (repayable and non-repayable contributions). **Description:** SIF is a federal fund targeting high-impact innovation projects across industries (e.g. manufacturing, life sciences, cleantech, digital industries). While not SME-exclusive, SIF does support projects in areas like AI, often through its streams for R\&D or commercialization. It typically caters to **consortia or mid-to-large projects**, but SMEs can be partners or recipients if the project is significant. For example, SIF has supported AI-focused initiatives in autonomous vehicles and supply chains. **Funding Details:** SIF can fund up to **50% of project costs** for eligible projects[\[40\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,FSI)[\[41\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,techniques). Contributions can be repayable “loans”, or non-repayable in some instances (especially for non-profit-led projects). The amounts are usually substantial (millions of dollars). **Eligibility:** Projects need to be transformative, large-scale, and aligned with government priorities. Typically the applicant is an incorporated company or consortium with a strong financial capacity (often not early-stage startups). SMEs may benefit through partnerships or if they have a highly scalable technology. **How to Apply:** SIF has a continuous intake with an initial statement of interest. Given its scope, it is less commonly accessed by typical SMEs unless working with larger partners or in a cluster project. (For most SME needs, programs like RAII or IRAP are more accessible.)

* **Scientific Research & Experimental Development (SR\&ED) Tax Incentive** – *Administered by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)*. **Type:** Tax credit (refund). **Description:** SR\&ED is a tax incentive program that rewards Canadian companies performing R\&D in science or technology. Many AI development activities qualify as SR\&ED, since creating new algorithms, improving machine learning models, or integrating AI systems can entail experimental development and technological uncertainty. **Funding Details:** The federal SR\&ED credit for SMEs is **35% refundable** on eligible R\&D expenditures (primarily salaries, subcontractors, and materials) up to a certain threshold, and 15% (non-refundable) on expenditures beyond that. In practice, an eligible small private company can recover up to **\~50% of the cost** of its R\&D once provincial SR\&ED credits are added[\[29\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,les%20entreprises%20tech%20et%20manufacturi%C3%A8res)[\[42\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=). For example, if an AI startup spends $100k on qualifying software development salaries, it might receive around $35k from the federal credit (refunded in cash) plus additional credit from its province. **Eligibility:** Any Canadian business that incurs R\&D expenses aimed at achieving a technological advancement can claim SR\&ED. The work must attempt to overcome a scientific or technical uncertainty – e.g., training an AI system beyond the state of the art or developing a novel AI technique could qualify. Both profitable and pre-revenue companies can benefit (credits are refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations under certain income thresholds). **How to Apply:** Claims are filed with the company’s tax return (Form T661 and provincial forms). Documentation of the R\&D work and costs is required. Deadlines are 18 months after the fiscal year-end in which the expenditures occurred. Companies often seek professional advice due to the detailed criteria. While not a direct grant, SR\&ED rebates significantly offset the cost of AI R\&D for many SMEs.

* **AI Superclusters and Industry Programs** – In addition to government programs, Canada’s **Innovation Superclusters** and industry-led initiatives provide funding and support that SMEs can access. For example, **Scale AI**, the Montreal-based AI supercluster focused on supply chains, co-funds collaborative projects that apply AI to supply chain challenges. Scale AI will fund up to **40–50% of eligible project costs** for consortia of companies (including SMEs) and research organizations developing AI solutions in areas like retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics[\[43\]](https://funding.ryan.com/government-funding/research-development/scale-ai/#:~:text=Supercluster%20funding,of%20AI%20for%20supply%20chains)[\[44\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,PME%20que%20les%20grandes%20entreprises). Participating SMEs can get significant non-dilutive funding by partnering with larger firms or academia on these projects. Scale AI also has an **Acceleration** program that invests in AI startup accelerators and an **AI talent** program for workforce development[\[45\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,les%20entreprises%20tech%20et%20manufacturi%C3%A8res)[\[46\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,l%27admissibilit%C3%A9%20et%20la%20conformit%C3%A9). Similarly, the **Next Generation Manufacturing Supercluster (NGen)** supports advanced manufacturing projects (often involving AI/automation) with funding up to 50% (for example, it offers up to $150k for certain smaller technology adoption projects)[\[47\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,NGen)[\[48\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=Max.%20150%20000%24%20Jusqu%27%C3%A0%2050,du%20projet%20Technologie%20Transformation%20num%C3%A9rique). SMEs in manufacturing can team with NGen to adopt AI-driven processes. Other sector initiatives – e.g. **Digital Technology Supercluster** (now Canada’s Digital Global Innovation Cluster in BC), **Protein Industries Canada** (agri-food tech), etc. – may have funding streams for projects that include AI components, where SMEs can participate. **Eligibility and Application:** Each supercluster has its own calls for proposals and membership requirements. Generally, an SME would join a consortium or respond to a project call aligned with the cluster’s themes. While these are not exclusively SME programs, they represent substantial funding opportunities for SME-led innovation with AI.

## Provincial and Territorial Programs

Every province and territory in Canada offers programs to support technology adoption and innovation by local SMEs, including specific initiatives for AI or digital transformation. Below, we break down programs by province/territory, highlighting those explicitly focused on helping SMEs implement AI or advanced digital technologies. These include direct funding (grants, loans), tax credits, and vouchers, as well as sector-specific funds.

### Ontario

Ontario SMEs can access both federal programs and a suite of provincial initiatives for digital adoption and innovation:

* **Ontario Digitalization Competence Centre (DCC)** – *Administered by the Ontario Centre of Innovation (OCI), funded by Ontario Ministry of Economic Development*. **Type:** Grants in two stages. **Description:** The DCC program helps SMEs modernize their operations and adopt new technologies (including advanced software, AI tools, e-commerce systems, etc.). It offers a **Digital Modernization and Adoption Plan (DMAP)** grant for planning and a follow-on **Technology Demonstration grant** for implementation[\[49\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=Of%20the%20%247,their%20Digital%20Modernization%20Adoption%20Plan)[\[50\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=The%20remaining%20%242,retailers%20access%20tools%20such%20as). **Funding Details:** Companies first engage a qualified consultant to assess digital needs; the program provides a **matching grant up to $15,000** (covering 50%) for this planning phase[\[49\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=Of%20the%20%247,their%20Digital%20Modernization%20Adoption%20Plan). After completing a “Digital Modernization Roadmap,” the SME can apply for implementation funding – up to **$100,000** matching grant – to invest in the technologies identified (for example, acquiring AI software or automating processes)[\[49\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=Of%20the%20%247,their%20Digital%20Modernization%20Adoption%20Plan). In 2025, Ontario expanded DCC to also include a **Retail Modernization Project grant**: retailers can get up to **$5,000 (50% match)** to adopt digital tools like e-commerce platforms, inventory management or AI-driven analytics for their stores[\[50\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=The%20remaining%20%242,retailers%20access%20tools%20such%20as). **Eligibility:** Ontario-based SMEs in any sector can apply. The retail stream is specifically for retail sector small businesses. Companies must contribute matching funds. Typically, an SME would need to demonstrate a desire to adopt “Made-in-Ontario” tech solutions or modernize operations. **How to Apply:** OCI opens calls periodically. As of 2025, intakes are open and funding is first-come, first-served. Applications are made through OCI’s website (the DCC portal). The program was launched in 2022 and, with renewed funding ($7.5 M announced in 2023), continues to accept new applicants[\[51\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=BRANTFORD%2C%20ON%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20Associate,term%20resilience)[\[52\]](https://www.oc-innovation.ca/media-releases/ontario-centre-of-innovation-expands-digital-support-for-small-businesses-with-7-5-million-investment-in-dcc/#:~:text=Launched%20in%202022%20and%20delivered,DMAP%29%20stream). There are separate application streams for DMAP versus the $5k Retail grant. No hard deadline is currently set; programs run until allocated funds are spent.

* **Ontario Innovation Tax Credit (OITC)** – *Administered by Ontario Ministry of Finance/CRA*. **Type:** Refundable tax credit. **Description:** The OITC is a 8% refundable tax credit on R\&D expenditures, available to Ontario SMEs performing scientific research & experimental development (SR\&ED). For AI-focused companies performing qualifying R\&D (such as developing new AI algorithms or proprietary AI software), the OITC provides a provincial top-up refund on top of the federal SR\&ED credit. **Funding Details:** SMEs (CCPCs with under $50 million assets) can receive 8% of eligible R\&D expenditures back as a cash refund (on up to $3 million of expenditures). This credit complements the federal 35% SR\&ED credit, effectively boosting the overall R\&D incentive. **Eligibility:** Must qualify for federal SR\&ED and have R\&D activities in Ontario. Most AI software development R\&D can qualify if there’s technological uncertainty being addressed. **How to Apply:** Claim is made via the company’s tax return alongside SR\&ED (no separate application, just forms). The credit is ongoing with no expiry.

* **Ontario Ventures and Grants for AI Startups** – *Administered by various agencies*. Ontario does not have a single AI-exclusive grant for general SMEs, but through agencies like OCI and Invest Ontario, it supports tech companies via investments and competitions. For example, in 2025 the **Toronto Region Board of Trade’s AI Business Catalyst** (supported by a $2.4 M FedDev Ontario RAII investment) began offering training and support to 75 SMEs in Southern Ontario to adopt AI solutions[\[53\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/economic-development-southern-ontario/news/2025/06/government-of-canada-supports-new-ai-business-catalyst-program.html#:~:text=an%20investment%20of%20%242,AIBC%29%20program)[\[54\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/economic-development-southern-ontario/news/2025/06/government-of-canada-supports-new-ai-business-catalyst-program.html#:~:text=The%20Toronto%20Region%20Board%20of,and%20help%20businesses%20compete%20globally). While not direct funding to businesses, programs like these provide subsidized AI advisory services and pilot opportunities. Additionally, Ontario’s **Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN)** and **Advanced Manufacturing programs** provide project funding that often involves AI (e.g. smart robotics). SMEs in relevant sectors (auto-tech, manufacturing) can tap into these targeted funds. **How to Apply:** Varies by program – typically through an open call or via regional innovation centers.

*(Ontario SMEs may also leverage national programs like RAII and IRAP in combination with these provincial supports. The Ontario government often coordinates with federal funding to maximize support.)*

### Quebec

Quebec has been very active in promoting AI, given its status as an AI research hub. The province offers several tailored funding programs and credits:

* **Programme Innovation – Volet Entreprises (Québec Innovation Program)** – *Administered by Investissement Québec (on behalf of Ministère de l’Économie, de l’Innovation et de l’Énergie, MEIE)*. **Type:** Grants or repayable contributions (depending on project). **Description:** This program supports innovation projects by Quebec companies, with priority to SMEs. It covers activities from prototyping to demonstration and commercialization. AI and digital technology projects are explicitly eligible[\[55\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,la%20transformation%20num%C3%A9rique%20sont%20admissibles). **Funding Details:** For smaller projects, the program offers non-repayable aid up to **60% of project cost to a maximum of $75,000**[\[56\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=Industrie%20admissible%20Financement%20admissible%20Type,du%20co%C3%BBt%20du%20projet%20Innovation). Larger projects may receive funding in a mix of grant and repayable form (the exact support depends on the nature and risk of the project). **Eligibility:** Quebec-based businesses (especially SMEs) undertaking R\&D or adoption of new technology. AI projects such as developing a new AI software or implementing an AI-based process improvement can qualify. Applicants in all industries are considered, as long as the project drives innovation or productivity. **How to Apply:** Applications are made to Investissement Québec and evaluated on innovation merit and economic benefits. There may be continuous intake or specific calls – interested firms should contact IQ for guidance. The program was ongoing in 2025 with specific “volets” (streams) for different project sizes.

* **ESSOR – Productivité innovation** – *Administered by Investissement Québec*. **Type:** Loan or grant (various components). **Description:** ESSOR is a suite of measures to increase business productivity through innovation and investment. Under the productivity and digital transformation stream, Quebec SMEs can get support for acquiring advanced technologies (including AI software, automation equipment, etc.). **Funding Details:** The program can provide **non-repayable contributions up to 50%** of eligible project costs (with typical maximum around **$50,000** per project for SMEs)[\[57\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,Transport%20et%20entreposage), or low-interest loans for larger capital investments. For instance, an SME implementing an AI-driven manufacturing system could get a grant for a portion of software and training costs. **Eligibility:** Quebec firms in sectors like manufacturing, wholesale/retail, transportation and others are eligible[\[57\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,Transport%20et%20entreposage). Projects should aim at measurable productivity gains (e.g. adopting AI to optimize operations). **How to Apply:** Through Investissement Québec. Applications are reviewed to ensure the project aligns with productivity improvement goals. The program has continuous intake; however, certain streams may open or close based on budget.

* **Tax Credit for the Development of E-Business – incorporating AI (CDAE-IA)** – *Administered by Revenu Québec*. **Type:** Refundable tax credit on salaries. **Description:** Quebec is transitioning its renowned e-business tax credit (Crédit pour le développement des affaires électroniques, CDAE) into a new variant that explicitly incentivizes AI-related work. Starting in 2026, the **CDAE-IA** will encourage companies to integrate AI functionalities into their IT solutions[\[58\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20the%20Quebec,developments%20and%20current%20business%20needs)[\[59\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=To%20encourage%20higher%20value,with%20their%20headquarters%20outside%20Quebec). **Funding Details:** Under the current CDAE (in effect through 2025), eligible companies receive a refundable credit of **30% of eligible salaries** (up to \~$25k per job) for employees developing eligible software or e-business solutions[\[42\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=). The new CDAE-IA will retain a similar structure but require projects to significantly integrate AI. It targets activities like AI-based software development, IT consulting that implements AI, and AI-enhanced cybersecurity solutions[\[60\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=Activities%20eligible%20for%20the%20CDAEIA,the%20main%20eligible%20activities%20are)[\[61\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=integrating%20AI%20functionalities,information%20and%20ensure%20user%20trust). The credit effectively subsidizes a portion of developer/data scientist salaries for companies doing AI/IT development in Quebec. **Eligibility:** Generally limited to **“eligible digital corporations”** – companies that derive a large share of their revenue from IT development or services and that employ a minimum number of full-time IT professionals in Quebec. Under CDAE-IA, the work must involve designing or integrating systems with AI (e.g. using machine learning, neural networks, etc.)[\[62\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=,developing%20these%20systems%2C%20businesses%20can)[\[63\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=More%20specifically%2C%20in%20the%20government%E2%80%99s,AI%20solutions%20can%20therefore%20include). This tends to include software firms, FinTech, gaming, and AI startups. **How to Apply:** Companies must obtain an eligibility certificate each year from Investissement Québec confirming they meet the criteria, then claim the credit on their provincial tax return. The transition to the AI-focused credit will apply to taxation years starting after Dec 31, 2025[\[64\]](https://abgi-canada.com/en/transition-from-cdae-to-cdaeia/#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20the%20Quebec,developments%20and%20current%20business%20needs). Companies already using CDAE should prepare to meet the new AI criteria.

* **Collaborative AI Projects – Quebec Calls (MEIE/Confiance AI)** – *Administered by MEIE via Investissement Québec, in partnership with innovation consortia*. **Type:** Grants for consortia projects. **Description:** Quebec periodically launches *Appels de projets* (calls for projects) to spur **collaborative innovation in AI**. One example is the 2025 **“Confiance IA” call** for industrial collaborative AI projects[\[65\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=Cet%20appel%20de%20projets%20lanc%C3%A9,projet%20d%E2%80%99innovation%20en%20intelligence%20artificielle)[\[66\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=,de%20file%20en%20mati%C3%A8re%20de). These programs aim to bring together multiple companies (including at least one SME) with research institutions to develop or adopt responsible AI solutions, particularly in sectors that have been slower to adopt AI (e.g. primary industries, traditional manufacturing)[\[67\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=,fait%20m%C3%AAme%2C%20dans%20la%20soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9). **Funding Details:** A typical call might provide up to **$1.5 million per project**, covering **35%–50% of eligible costs** (higher rates for startups or if academic research involvement is significant)[\[68\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=)[\[69\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=Le%20taux%20sera%20major%C3%A9%20%C3%A0,des%20d%C3%A9penses%20admissibles%20du%20projet). For instance, if two SMEs partner with a university lab to develop an AI system for agriculture, the government could fund 35% of each company’s costs (and 50% of the university’s costs) up to the cap. The consortium members must fund the remainder. **Eligibility:** Requirements usually include a *minimum of two Quebec companies*, at least one of which is an SME, collaborating on an AI innovation or adoption project[\[70\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=Admissibilit%C3%A9)[\[71\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=Les%20%C3%A9quipes%20projets%20admissibles%20doivent,%C3%A0%20minima%20compos%C3%A9%20de). Projects need to align with objectives like improving competitiveness through AI adoption, advancing responsible AI, and yielding economic benefits in Quebec[\[67\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=,fait%20m%C3%AAme%2C%20dans%20la%20soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9)[\[72\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=,responsable%20et%20de%20technologies%20quantiques). Sectors of focus can be broad (any with potential for “responsible AI integration”). The SME(s) should have the capacity to implement the solution pilot. **How to Apply:** Calls are announced by MEIE or through organizations like Confiance IA or Prompt. There are two-stage applications (often an initial letter of intent, followed by full proposal). In the 2025 call, **letters of intent were due March 4, 2025** and full proposals April 15, 2025[\[73\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=D%C3%A9p%C3%B4t%20lettre%20d%E2%80%99intention%20%C3%A0%20Confiance,IA)[\[74\]](https://www.confianceia.ca/programme/appel-de-projets-dinnovation-en-intelligence-artificielle-recherche-industrielle-en-collaboration-et-soutien-a-lentrepreneuriat/#:~:text=4%20mars%202025). Selection is competitive, based on innovation merit and economic impact. Companies should watch for new calls (usually annual or bi-annual) through Quebec’s innovation portals.

* **NovaScience Program (Talent for AI)** – *Administered by MEIE*. **Type:** Grants for hiring and training. **Description:** NovaScience is a Quebec program to develop scientific and technical talent. It offers funding to companies and non-profits for initiatives like hiring young graduates, supporting internships (stages), or training employees in emerging technologies, including AI. **Funding Details:** NovaScience can cover up to **50–80% of eligible costs** related to talent development in AI and STEM, up to a maximum grant (commonly around $200k)[\[75\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=,les%20PME%20et%20OBNL%20innovants)[\[76\]](https://baseline.quebec/nouvelle/subvention-en-ia/#:~:text=). For example, an SME could get a wage subsidy to hire a recent AI graduate or funds to run an AI training workshop for staff. **Eligibility:** Quebec SMEs, educational organizations, and non-profits engaged in projects to build skilled workforce in innovation fields. AI projects that help integrate young talent into companies or increase AI literacy in the organization are prioritized. **How to Apply:** There are periodic calls under NovaScience. Applicants submit proposals detailing the training or internship plan and expected outcomes. Deadlines vary (often annual intakes). In evaluating, the province looks for projects that will increase the long-term AI capacity of the business or region.

*(Quebec SMEs additionally benefit from Canada’s Scale AI cluster which co-invests in industry projects, and from a robust ecosystem (Mila, IVADO, etc.) that provides support through accelerators and mentorship alongside these funding programs.)*

### British Columbia

British Columbia supports SME technology adoption through both federal cluster funding and its own programs:

* **BC On-Farm Technology Adoption Program** – *Administered by Innovate BC in partnership with BC Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada*. **Type:** Cost-shared grant. **Description:** Aimed at the agriculture sector, this program helps farmers and agri-business SMEs adopt innovative technologies – which can include AI-driven solutions like precision agriculture sensors, farm management software with AI analytics, robotics, etc. It was launched in 2023 to strengthen food security and productivity[\[77\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/agriculture-agri-food/news/2024/06/automation-robotics-helping-farmers-strengthen-food-security.html#:~:text=Automation%2C%20robotics%20helping%20farmers%20strengthen,technology%20to%20enhance%20profitability%2C). **Funding Details:** Provides **cost-share funding up to $150,000** per farm business to purchase and implement new technology[\[77\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/agriculture-agri-food/news/2024/06/automation-robotics-helping-farmers-strengthen-food-security.html#:~:text=Automation%2C%20robotics%20helping%20farmers%20strengthen,technology%20to%20enhance%20profitability%2C). The cost share is typically 50% (i.e. the program covers half the cost up to that max). For example, a farm investing in an AI-powered crop monitoring drone system costing $200k could receive $100k from the program. **Eligibility:** Eligible applicants are B.C. farmers, ranchers, or agri-food producers. They must propose technology investments that enhance efficiency, profitability, or sustainability. AI tools qualify if they clearly benefit the farming operation. The farm must be in B.C. and the project completed within program timelines (the initiative was initially a two-year fund, 2023–2025). **How to Apply:** Applications are submitted to Innovate BC or its delivery partner (which manages intakes). The program is competitive; farmers needed to outline the tech, vendor quotes, and anticipated improvements. In its first call, demand exceeded funding, so strong business cases were essential. Deadlines were set for each intake (for instance, one in 2023 and another in 2024). Future continuation will depend on funding renewals.

* **Innovate BC – Fast Pilot Program** – *Administered by Innovate BC*. **Type:** Grant for pilot projects. **Description:** The Fast Pilot program (also known as BC Fast Pilot) helps B.C. technology SMEs pilot and demonstrate their innovations with industry partners. While not exclusively for AI, many pilots involve AI or machine learning solutions (e.g. an AI startup piloting its software at a customer site). **Funding Details:** Typically offers up to **$200,000** per pilot project, often covering 50% of the project cost (so, a $400k pilot would get $200k). It enables SMEs to offset the cost of deploying a prototype in a real-world setting. **Eligibility:** B.C.-based SMEs developing an innovative product can apply, but they must have a committed pilot partner (an industry organization, company or public sector partner in B.C. that will host the pilot). AI startups with a ready prototype and an interested customer for a pilot are ideal candidates. **How to Apply:** Innovate BC issues calls (in the past, annually). The SME submits a proposal describing the innovation, the pilot plan, and the partner’s involvement. A letter of support from the pilot partner is usually required. Intakes are competitive and reviewed by experts. Companies should monitor Innovate BC’s website for the next call.

* **BC Technology Co‑op Grants and Talent** – *Administered by Innovate BC*. While not direct project funding, B.C. offers **Tech Co-op Grants** that provide up to $5,000 in wage subsidy for each co-op student a tech SME hires. An AI company can use this to hire a student in data science or software development. B.C. also has programs through **Mitacs, ICTC, and NRC** to place subsidized AI interns in SMEs (helping build internal AI capacity).

* **Digital Supercluster Initiatives** – B.C. is home to Canada’s Digital Technology Supercluster (now named Digital Global Innovation Cluster). Through this federal–industry partnership, SMEs in B.C. have opportunities to join collaborative projects on digital innovation (many involving AI) and receive funding. For example, some **COVID-19 response projects** funded by the cluster had AI components with SME participation. While not a provincial government program, the cluster (based in Vancouver) is a key resource for B.C. companies to gain both expertise and co-funding (often 50% of project costs) for ambitious AI projects in fields like healthcare, mining, and communications. **How to Apply:** The cluster releases calls for projects and accepts proposals from consortia. B.C. SMEs should consider joining as industry members to access these opportunities.

*(B.C. SMEs can also use national programs like IRAP, and region-specific funds via PacifiCan (the federal economic development agency for BC). In 2024, PacifiCan launched RAII in B.C., with similar parameters to PrairiesCan – e.g. interest-free repayable funding up to 50% for AI adoption projects, leveraging the federal Budget 2024 AI initiative[\[78\]](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/economic-development/funding-and-grants/regional-artificial-intelligence-initiative#:~:text=Regional%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Initiative%20,or%20adopting%20artificial%20intelligence).)*

Proposals undergo expert review. Successful projects sign an investment agreement with Alberta Innovates. Companies in health AI should watch AI’s calls or subscribe to their updates.

* **Innovation Employment Grant (IEG)** – *Administered by Alberta Treasury*. **Type:** Tax credit (grant on tax return). **Description:** IEG is Alberta’s incentive for R\&D since 2021\. It functions as a refundable tax credit for SME R\&D expenditures (replacing Alberta’s old SR\&ED credit). AI and software development R\&D expenses qualify. **Funding Details:** Provides up to **20%** back on a company’s qualifying R\&D spend[\[94\]](https://www.alberta.ca/supports-technology-businesses#:~:text=Innovation%20Employment%20Grant). The credit is on a **sliding scale**: 8% base rate, with an enhanced rate up to 20% on incremental R\&D beyond past levels. It’s fully refundable for eligible firms. **Eligibility:** Alberta-based Canadian Controlled Private Corporations performing SR\&ED. Small companies (under $10M taxable capital) get the full benefit; it tapers for larger firms. **How to Apply:** File the Alberta schedule with the corporate tax return (coordinate with federal SR\&ED claim). This is available annually with no sunset, as part of Alberta’s fiscal policy to spur innovation.

* **Product Demonstration Program (PDP)** – *Administered by Alberta Innovates*. **Type:** Grant. **Description:** Similar to BC’s pilot program, Alberta’s PDP helps SMEs pilot new products through partnerships (often business-to-business demonstrations). If an Alberta SME has an AI solution (say, an AI software for oil & gas analytics), PDP can fund a pilot deployment with a corporate partner in that sector. **Funding Details:** Provides up to **50% of project costs, to a max of $300,000** (as of recent guidelines) for a pilot that accelerates commercialization[\[95\]](https://www.alberta.ca/supports-technology-businesses#:~:text=in%20technology%20and%20knowledge)[\[96\]](https://www.alberta.ca/supports-technology-businesses#:~:text=Product%20Demonstration%20Program). **Eligibility:** Alberta SME with a near-commercial innovation and a committed industry partner to test it. All industries are eligible, but alignment with Alberta’s key sectors (energy, agriculture, etc.) is a plus. **How to Apply:** Through Alberta Innovates. There are periodic calls or continuous intake with cutoff dates. Business and technical merit of the pilot are assessed. The company must show that the partner is engaged and that the pilot could lead to broader adoption.

*(Alberta’s ecosystem also includes* *Amii (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute)* *which, while not a funding agency, offers subsidized programs and mentorship to help companies adopt AI. Through Amii, SMEs can access initiatives like the* *AI Accelerator* *or* *AI Lab* *programs, often supported by government funding, to build internal AI capacity. Furthermore, Alberta SMEs continue to heavily utilize NRC IRAP and federal RAII funds for AI projects in the province.)*

### Saskatchewan

Saskatchewan leverages federal programs and targeted provincial initiatives to spur tech adoption by its growing startup community:

* **Made in Saskatchewan Technology (MIST) Program** – *Administered by Innovation Saskatchewan*. **Type:** Grant for pilot projects. **Description:** MIST connects Saskatchewan tech startups with provincial government entities to pilot home-grown innovations. Essentially, it allows an SME to have the government as a beta customer. Many of these innovations involve software and AI solutions for public sector challenges (for instance, an AgTech company using AI for crop insurance assessments partnered with a government insurance agency under MIST)[\[97\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=,province%20by%20providing%20comprehensive%20trail)[\[98\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=Corporation%20www,hikes%20locally%20or%20during%20vacations). **Funding Details:** MIST **matches the project costs up to $30,000** for a pilot[\[99\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=inception%20in%202019)[\[100\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=The%20program%20funding%20matches%20project,profit%20organizations%20and%20municipalities). In other words, the startup gets a grant equal to the amount the government partner is spending (effectively doubling the resources up to $30k from IS plus $30k from the partner). This funding helps cover the startup’s expenses during the pilot. **Eligibility:** Saskatchewan-based technology startups/SMEs are eligible. They must have an innovative product ready to pilot and secure a provincial ministry, Crown corporation, municipality, or non-profit in Saskatchewan as the pilot partner[\[99\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=inception%20in%202019)[\[100\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=The%20program%20funding%20matches%20project,profit%20organizations%20and%20municipalities). The solution should address a problem relevant to that partner. AI solutions are welcome – indeed, one example is a geospatial AI startup piloting its platform with a Crop Insurance agency[\[97\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=,province%20by%20providing%20comprehensive%20trail)[\[98\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=Corporation%20www,hikes%20locally%20or%20during%20vacations). **How to Apply:** Innovation Saskatchewan issues a call for MIST applications (typically annually). Startups often pre-arrange a partnership with a government unit, then jointly apply. In 2023–24, IS funded four pilots and hit a record allocation, indicating strong interest[\[101\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=Innovation%20Saskatchewan%20invested%20%2492%2C500%20in,since%20its%20inception%20in%202019)[\[102\]](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/may/28/innovation-saskatchewan-invests-92500-in-technology-pilot-projects-through-the-mist-program#:~:text=well%20as%20Saskatchewan%20non,and%20municipalities). Applications involve detailing the solution, the pilot plan, and the value to the public partner. The program’s popularity means it’s competitive; having a clear public benefit and committed partner is key.

* **Digital Literacy and Automation Grants:** Saskatchewan’s government has programs like **Training vouchers** and **Digital literacy grants** to help SMEs train employees in new tech (often delivered via Saskatchewan Polytechnic or others). While not direct AI project funding, these support workforce upskilling (for example, sending staff to an AI in agriculture course). Additionally, **Canada-Saskatchewan Job Grant** provides up to 2/3 of the cost of training employees (including on AI tools or software) – an important resource for SMEs adopting new technologies that require staff training.

* **Saskatchewan Technology Startup Incentive (STSI)** – *Administered by Innovation Saskatchewan*. **Type:** Tax incentive (for investors). **Description:** STSI is an angel investor tax credit (45% credit for investments in Saskatchewan startups). It indirectly benefits AI startups by encouraging investment into them, providing them capital to grow. While not directly an adoption fund, it’s a notable program in Saskatchewan’s tech ecosystem. **Funding Details:** Investors in eligible startups (which could be AI startups) receive a 45% non-refundable tax credit, up to $225k credit per investor per year. **Eligibility:** Startups must be approved as “eligible” (under 50 employees, doing innovative work in SK). AI companies easily qualify as innovative. **How to Apply:** Startups apply to get on the eligible list; investors then apply for credits after investing. This program is ongoing and extended to 2025\.

*(Saskatchewan firms also utilize PrairiesCan’s RAII funding – e.g., in August 2025, PrairiesCan announced $1.3 M in interest-free loans to three Sask. companies for AI adoption projects[\[103\]](https://innovationsask.ca/news/1-3m-to-accelerate-ai-in-saskatchewan/#:~:text=Prairies%20Economic%20Development%20Canada%20,AI%29)[\[104\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/news/2025/08/minister-olszewski-announces-funding-to-help-saskatchewan-businesses-lead-in-ai-innovation.html#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan%20%E2%80%93). Moreover, IRAP and NRC’s Digital Agriculture programs are leveraged by many Sask. agri-food tech SMEs to advance AI and automation in farming.)*

### Manitoba

Manitoba offers programs to boost innovation and tech adoption, often in partnership with federal initiatives:

* **Innovation Growth Program (IGP)** – *Administered by Manitoba Economic Development*. **Type:** Cost-shared grant. **Description:** IGP supports Manitoba SMEs in commercializing innovative new products or technologies. AI-related projects (e.g. developing an AI-driven software product or implementing an advanced manufacturing process) are eligible. **Funding Details:** Provides a **non-repayable grant up to $100,000 per project, covering 50%** of eligible costs[\[105\]](https://www.gov.mb.ca/jec/busdev/financial/igp/index.html#:~:text=Innovation%20Growth%20Program%20%C2%B7%20The,a%2050%2F50%20cost%20shared%20basis). The company must match the other 50%. This grant can fund product development, testing, patenting, marketing for new tech, etc. It has been used by local tech startups (e.g. an AI company developing carbon tracking software received $100k from IGP[\[106\]](https://standardcarbon.ai/innovation-growth/#:~:text=Standard%20Carbon%20Receives%20%24100k%20Innovation,and%20deployment%20of%20SCOP3%2C)). **Eligibility:** Manitoba-based small or medium businesses with a novel product/process close to commercialization. The project should clearly lead to growth (new revenues, jobs). AI projects qualify as long as they have a tangible product or service to commercialize. **How to Apply:** IGP runs periodic intakes (usually one or two calls per year). Companies submit a detailed application (business plan, project budget, milestones). A government committee evaluates proposals on innovation, economic impact, and viability. In 2025, the program supported multiple companies and continues to be funded (Manitoba’s 2025 budget injected funds to expand innovation incentives).

* **Digital Manitoba Initiative (TechUP and PowerUP)** – *Administered in 2021–22 by Manitoba Chambers and Province*. **Type:** Grants (one-time COVID response program). **Description:** Mentioned as it was a significant tech adoption grant program, though now concluded. TechUP offered micro-grants up to $5k for basic digital upgrades, and PowerUP offered up to $25k for more substantial tech projects[\[107\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=,rapidly%20implement%20basic%20digital%20improvements)[\[108\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=,could%20enhance%20productivity%20and%20competitiveness). Hundreds of SMEs used these to get e-commerce, remote work tools, or initial analytics capabilities[\[109\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=could%20enhance%20productivity%20and%20competitiveness). While not AI-specific, a few forward-thinking firms may have implemented entry-level AI solutions. **Status:** These grants fully subscribed and ended by 2022[\[110\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=adopt%20remote%20work%20and%20collaboration,tools). As of 2025, no direct replacement exists, but Manitoba SMEs can use the federal CDAP program for similar purposes.

* **Manitoba Digital Economy and Skills Programs:** Manitoba participates in federal programs like CDAP (via a local service network) and runs the **Canada-Manitoba Job Grant** for training. SMEs adopting new AI systems can get up to 75% of training costs for their staff covered, up to $10k per employee[\[111\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20important,Job%20Grant%20initiative%2C%20tailored%20for)[\[112\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/small-businesses/manitoba#:~:text=training%20costs%20for%20employers%20with,training%20providers%2C%20required%20textbooks%20or). Also, organizations like North Forge or Tech Manitoba provide mentorship and sometimes small grants (or competitions) for tech startups in Winnipeg – these can indirectly help AI entrepreneurs.

*(Manitoba firms also benefit from Western Canada initiatives: for example, through PrairiesCan’s Business Scale-up and Productivity (BSP) program. In recent years, PrairiesCan (formerly Western Diversification) provided repayable funding to several Manitoba companies for tech scale-up. If an AI-focused Manitoba SME is in a high-growth phase, they might secure a BSP loan (often 0%-interest repayable) covering up to 50% of expansion costs. One such case: in 2024, FedNor (Northern Ontario, similar to FedDev) and NORCAT announced $1.05 M to help Northern Ontario startups adopt new tech, illustrating the availability of regional fed funding[\[113\]](https://www.norcat.org/Government-of-Canada-invests-over-1-million-in-innovation-in-Northern-Ontario#:~:text=Government%20of%20Canada%20invests%20over,new%20technologies%2C%20and%20compete%20globally).)*

### Atlantic Canada (NS, NB, PE, NL)

SMEs in Atlantic Canada have access not only to provincial programs but also strong support from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) and related bodies. Key programs include:

* **Atlantic Innovation Fund (AIF)** – *Administered by ACOA*. **Type:** Non-repayable contributions for R\&D. **Description:** AIF provides substantial funding for research and innovation projects in Atlantic Canada, often involving industry-academic collaboration. AI projects led by SMEs (or with SME partners) have been funded, especially if they align with regional strengths (oceans, fisheries, health, etc.). **Funding Details:** AIF can cover up to **75% of project costs** (for private sector-led projects) and often invests **$500k to $3M**\+ per project. It’s one of the larger pools for innovation in the region. **Eligibility:** Atlantic Canadian businesses with a major innovation project (e.g. developing a new AI-driven product), preferably in collaboration with local universities or colleges. The project must have strong commercialization potential and regional benefits. **How to Apply:** ACOA calls for AIF proposals periodically. It’s competitive and rigorous (detailed proposals, due diligence). SMEs often partner with a research institution to strengthen the application.

* **Regional Economic Growth through Innovation – Business Scale-up and Productivity (BSP)** – *Administered by ACOA (and other regional agencies)*. **Type:** Repayable funding (interest-free loan). **Description:** BSP provides growth capital to scaling companies. In Atlantic Canada, ACOA’s BSP has supported many tech firms. An SME adopting AI to boost productivity or scaling an AI-based product could get an interest-free repayable contribution. **Funding Details:** Typically covers up to **35%–50% of project costs**, often in the range of $500k to $2M. Repayment is over 5–7 years, interest-free. **Eligibility:** High-growth Atlantic firms with a solid business plan for scaling revenue and creating jobs. Project could be purchasing advanced equipment, implementing an AI system, expanding production, etc. **How to Apply:** Continuous intake via ACOA regional offices. A thorough application and due diligence process is required.

* **Nova Scotia Productivity and Innovation Voucher** – *Administered by Invest Nova Scotia (formerly NSBI)*. **Type:** Voucher (grant) for R\&D services. **Description:** This long-running program helps NS SMEs get help from local universities and colleges to solve business challenges or develop new products. Many SMEs use it to access expertise in data science, AI, engineering, etc. **Funding Details:** Two tiers of vouchers: **Tier 1: $15,000** (max) and **Tier 2: $25,000** (max), which cover the cost of R\&D services by the institution[\[114\]](https://www.dal.ca/research-and-innovation/innovation-industry-partnerships/research-development-partnerships/industry-funding/productivity-and-innovation-voucher-program.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L259%20There%20are,at%20a%20maximum%20of%20%2425%2C000)[\[115\]](https://www.dal.ca/research-and-innovation/innovation-industry-partnerships/research-development-partnerships/industry-funding/productivity-and-innovation-voucher-program.html#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20levels%20of,at%20a%20maximum%20of%20%2425%2C000). The SME pays nothing (the funds go directly to the institution). Often Tier 2 is for companies that already had a Tier 1 in a prior year. **Eligibility:** Nova Scotia SMEs (registered businesses with \<500 employees) in good standing. They must collaborate with an eligible post-secondary institution in NS. Projects can include developing a prototype, testing a technology, or research into adopting an AI technique, etc. Many sectors are supported. **How to Apply:** Annual call (usually late summer). In 2025, 54 companies were awarded vouchers, indicating strong uptake[\[116\]\[117\]](https://investnovascotia.ca/news-and-stories/meet-2025-26-pivp-cohort#:~:text=This%20year%2C%2054%20Nova%20Scotia,entrepreneurs%20are%20building%20what%E2%80%99s%20next). Application is a short proposal outlining the project, the chosen research partner, and how it will improve the business. It’s a competitive process evaluated by a panel, but roughly 50+ vouchers are granted each year. Deadlines and guidelines are published on Invest Nova Scotia’s site and promoted via universities.

* **New Brunswick Innovation Voucher Fund** – *Administered by New Brunswick Innovation Foundation (NBIF)*. **Type:** Voucher/Grant. **Description:** NBIF offers an Innovation Voucher that is similar to NS’s, enabling NB SMEs to collaborate with universities or research organizations on innovation. **Funding Details:** Provides **$10,000 to $80,000**, covering up to **80% of project costs** with an NB research institution[\[118\]\[119\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/technology/new-brunswick#:~:text=Eligible%20Funding). For example, an NB manufacturer could use it to work with UNB on integrating AI into their production line, with NBIF funding 80% of the professor’s and students’ costs. **Eligibility:** New Brunswick SMEs in targeted sectors (manufacturing, ICT, agriculture, etc.)[\[120\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/technology/new-brunswick#:~:text=Eligible%20Industries). Must partner with an approved NB knowledge provider (university, college, R\&D centre). Projects should be geared toward commercialization or solving a technical problem. **How to Apply:** NBIF accepts applications on a rolling basis. The company typically discusses the project with NBIF and the researcher, then submits a proposal. If approved, NBIF issues the voucher and disburses funds to the research partner.

* **NBIF Startup and Venture Funding** – *Administered by NBIF*. While not strictly “adoption funding,” NBIF’s equity investments and loans (e.g. Startup Investment Fund up to $200k[\[121\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/technology/new-brunswick#:~:text=Other%20Support%20Partnering%20and%20Collaboration,Loans%20and%20Capital%20investments%20Open)[\[122\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/grants-and-funding/technology/new-brunswick#:~:text=,Professional%2C%20scientific%20and%20technical%20services)) provide capital to innovative NB startups, including those focused on AI. This capital can indirectly finance product development and market entry. NBIF also runs challenges and acceleration programs that occasionally grant small amounts of money or in-kind services to AI startups.

* **Prince Edward Island – Small Business Assistance & Investment Grants**:

* **PEI Small Business Assistance Program** – *Administered by Innovation PEI*. **Type:** Small grant. **Description:** This program helps PEI small businesses improve their operations through planning, process improvements, or marketing. It will fund activities that indirectly support tech adoption (such as hiring a consultant to plan an AI integration, or doing market research for a new tech product). **Funding Details:** Covers **50% of eligible costs up to $4,000**[\[123\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/programs/innovation-pei-small-business-assistance#:~:text=Get%20up%20to%20%244%2C000%20to,you%20are%20a%20new%20business)[\[124\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/programs/innovation-pei-small-business-assistance#:~:text=How%20much%20funding%20can%20be,received). Eligible costs include professional services for business plans, process improvement consulting (up to $5k cost, i.e. $2.5k grant), and marketing for new businesses[\[125\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/programs/innovation-pei-small-business-assistance#:~:text=Yes%2C%20there%20are%20eligible%20expenses,the%20Small%20Business%20Assistance%20grant)[\[126\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/programs/innovation-pei-small-business-assistance#:~:text=,promotional%20materials%20for%20new%20businesses).

Projects are evaluated on innovation, export potential, and economic benefit to PEI.

* **Newfoundland & Labrador – Business Innovation Programs**:

* **NL Business Growth Program (BGP)** – *Administered by Dept. of Industry, Energy and Technology (IET)*. **Type:** Non-repayable contribution (grant). **Description:** BGP is a flexible fund to help NL SMEs grow, innovate, and improve productivity. It consolidates various support (innovation, technology adoption, market development) under one program. **Funding Details:** Provides up to **50% of project costs**, with typical maximums of **$100,000 per year** (and $200,000 over two years for a single project)[\[146\]](https://funding.ryan.com/blog/government-funding/newfoundland-and-labrador-2025-budget/#:~:text=Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%202025%20Budget,Development%20and)[\[147\]](https://www.gov.nl.ca/iet/funding/business-growth-program/#:~:text=Business%20Growth%20Program%20,100%2C000). It can fund a wide range of activities: purchase of advanced technology, software, skills development, productivity consulting, product development, etc. For example, if an SME wants to implement an AI-based process automation, BGP could pay half the costs (software, training, etc.) up to the limit. **Eligibility:** Newfoundland & Labrador SMEs in good standing. Projects should demonstrate how they will lead to business growth (e.g. increased revenue, new jobs) or innovation. All sectors can apply, though priority may be given to key sectors (ocean tech, ICT, natural resources, etc.). **How to Apply:** Through IET’s website, SMEs fill out an application form with details on the project plan and budget. There is continuous intake, but funding is limited so early application in the fiscal year is wise. Decisions are made by IET based on the project’s merits and economic impact. Businesses can receive multiple different IET supports but usually not for the same expenses.

* **NL Research and Innovation Program (R\&I)** – *Administered by IET*. **Type:** Grant. **Description:** This program supports R\&D and innovation projects in NL. It’s often used by companies (or partnerships with academia) to develop or test new tech. Many projects involve ICT and AI. **Funding Details:** Provides up to **50% of eligible project costs, typically capped at $200,000** over 1–2 years[\[148\]](https://www.gov.nl.ca/iet/funding/research-and-innovation-program/#:~:text=Technology%20www,Capital%20costs%20including%20building). Eligible costs include R\&D salaries, equipment, software, contractor fees, etc.[\[149\]](https://www.gov.nl.ca/iet/funding/research-and-innovation-program/#:~:text=Technology%20www,Capital%20costs%20including%20building). **Eligibility:** NL-based organizations (businesses, research orgs) advancing a novel product or process. AI projects such as developing a new machine learning application or applying AI to solve an industry problem are eligible. **How to Apply:** Similar to BGP, via IET. A proposal detailing the R\&D project, timeline and budget is required. If collaborating with MUN or CNA (college), that strengthens the proposal. Intake is ongoing.

* **Industry-Specific Funds in NL:** Newfoundland and Labrador also has specialized funds like the **Innovation and Business Development Fund (IBDF)** for oil & gas tech (includes digital tech)[\[150\]](https://hellodarwin.com/business-aid/programs/innovation-and-business-development-fund#:~:text=Innovation%20and%20Business%20Development%20Fund,and%20gas%20projects%20in%20NL), and **trade/export support programs** that help tech SMEs (including AI startups) attend trade shows or pursue international markets. The province in 2025 also invested in **AI training programs** (nearly $2 M to CNA for AI skills training)[\[151\]](https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2025/ipgs/0507n03/#:~:text=,Labrador%20Association%20of%20Community) – not direct funding to SMEs but aimed at growing the talent pool for companies.

*(Across Atlantic Canada, provincial programs are often complemented by ACOA’s contributions. For example, ACOA’s* *Business Development Program (BDP)* *provides smaller-scale assistance – grants or loans – to SMEs for activities like hiring expertise, conducting market research, or obtaining technology. While BDP is broad, an SME could request a contribution for, say, hiring an AI consultant to implement a solution. BDP typically funds up to 50% of costs and is accessible via local ACOA offices. Furthermore, Atlantic provinces offer generous R\&D tax credits: e.g., Newfoundland and Nova Scotia have 15% provincial SR\&ED credits (Nova Scotia’s is refundable for SMEs), New Brunswick offers a 15% credit (recently made non-refundable), and PEI has a 15% SR\&ED credit. These credits add on top of federal SR\&ED to support R\&D including AI development.)*

### Northern Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut)

In the territories, SME support for technology and innovation often comes through federal programs (CanNor – the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency – delivers RAII and other initiatives) and territorial government funds aimed at economic development:

* **Canadian Northern Economic Dev. Agency (CanNor) – AI Initiatives:** CanNor is rolling out the RAII AI funding in the North, similar to other regions, to help northern businesses adopt AI and develop AI solutions suited for northern challenges[\[152\]](https://www.cannor.gc.ca/eng/1731601687376/1731601710675#:~:text=Regional%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Initiative%20,for%20Canadians%20and%20compete%20globally). This would provide up to 50% funding for SME projects in Yukon, NWT, and Nunavut, focusing on sectors like mining, renewable energy, and community healthcare where AI could be transformative. Interested northern SMEs should contact CanNor’s offices for RAII application details (intake aligns with the national RAII timeline).

* **Yukon Economic Development Fund (EDF)** – *Administered by Yukon Government*. **Type:** Grant. **Description:** The EDF supports projects that stimulate Yukon’s economic growth and diversification[\[153\]](https://yukon.ca/en/edf#:~:text=The%20Economic%20Development%20Fund%20supports,to%20Yukoners%20and%20Yukon%20communities). This can include SMEs implementing innovative technology or scaling up. **Funding Details:** It can fund up to 50% (sometimes more for non-profits) of project costs. In the past, EDF has funded the launch of tech pilot projects and feasibility studies. Specific funding amounts vary; many projects are in the tens of thousands of dollars range. **Eligibility:** Yukon businesses, First Nations, and organizations with projects that create economic benefits (new jobs, new capabilities in Yukon). If an AI project will, say, allow a Yukon company to expand its services outside the territory or improve efficiency, it likely qualifies. **How to Apply:** Calls for applications are announced (often annually). Applicants submit a proposal to Yukon’s Dept. of Economic Development. The **next deadline** is typically in mid-winter (e.g., January 15 for winter intake as advertised on Yukon.ca)[\[154\]](https://www.facebook.com/yukongov/posts/take-your-business-or-project-to-the-next-level-with-the-economic-development-fu/891293896514577/#:~:text=Apply%20to%20the%20Economic%20Development,by%20January%2015%20for).

* **Yukon Innovation Fund (YIF)** – *Administered by Yukon University (YukonU) Innovation & Entrepreneurship*. **Type:** Grant/Support. **Description:** YIF is a fund to help Yukoners develop and test innovative ideas or processes[\[155\]](https://www.yukonu.ca/innovation/innovation-fund#:~:text=Innovation%20Fund%20,develop%20or%20deploy%20your%20ideas). It’s relatively small-scale but can be used by an entrepreneur or SME to build a prototype or pilot a concept (including AI-related ideas) with mentorship from YukonU. **Funding Details:** YIF provides funding (historically up to $10,000) plus in-kind support like coaching and workspace. **Eligibility:** Individuals, startups or SMEs in Yukon with a new innovative idea. **How to Apply:** Through YukonU’s Innovation & Entrepreneurship office. Calls are periodic.

* **NWT SEED (Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development)** – *Administered by GNWT ITI*. **Type:** Grants. **Description:** SEED is a broad program offering grants to NWT businesses for startups, capital investments, market development, and skills. It has streams like Sector Support which could fund technology adoption, and Business Development which might fund planning or equipment. **Funding Details:** The maximum SEED contribution to one applicant per year is $75,000 (most grants are smaller). For example, an SME could get $30k toward purchasing new software or equipment (like an AI-driven mapping system for a geomatics firm) under SEED Capital Asset stream. **Eligibility:** NWT businesses (must be majority NWT resident-owned). **How to Apply:** Via local ITI regional offices, year-round until funds deplete. Applications involve a simple form and quotes for expenses.

* **Nunavut – Strategic Investments Program (SIP)** – *Administered by Nunavut Dept. of Economic Dev. & Transportation*. **Type:** Contribution (grant). **Description:** Nunavut SIP provides contributions to businesses for initiatives that diversify the economy. If a Nunavut business or Inuit-owned firm wants to adopt a new technology to enhance operations (say, an AI tool for fisheries management), they could seek SIP funding. **Funding Details:** Up to $25,000 for small projects (higher for community projects or those with broad impact). **Eligibility:** Nunavut-registered businesses and organizations. **How to Apply:** Through regional Economic Development officers. Proposals reviewed on economic merits; intakes usually annually.

*(Businesses in the territories also leverage federal grants: IRAP has Industrial Technology Advisors serving the North, and can fund northern SME R\&D (with enhanced travel and cost allowances). Also, the federal Northern REACHE program has funded some clean energy tech pilots using smart controls (AI-based energy management in remote communities). While fewer territorial-specific programs target AI explicitly, the general business development funds are flexible enough to cover technology adoption. Partnerships with southern institutions are often encouraged to build capacity.*)

**Sources:** Program websites and guides as cited above (e.g. Canada.ca, provincial portals, helloDarwin program summaries).

*Table Notes:* “Max Funding/Rate” is a general guideline; many programs consider each case and may offer less than the max. “Type of Funding” distinguishes grants (non-repayable), contributions that are repayable (loans), and credits. Always check the latest program specifics and intake status, as funding amounts and criteria can change with new budgets.

## Conclusion

Canadian SMEs seeking to adopt or develop AI technologies have an unprecedented array of funding options in 2025\. From large federal initiatives like RAII and AI Compute Access, to targeted provincial grants and tax credits, businesses can find support at every stage – whether it’s early R\&D, hiring an expert, purchasing AI software, or piloting an AI solution in their operations. Importantly, many programs can be combined: for instance, an SME might use a provincial voucher to collaborate with a university (developing a prototype AI algorithm), claim SR\&ED credits on that R\&D, then leverage a federal RAII contribution or a CDAP loan to implement the AI system company-wide. SMEs are encouraged to explore both national and regional programs, and to reach out to program administrators or regional innovation agencies (like Innovation Canada’s portal or provincial innovation offices) for guidance on eligibility and application processes. With thoughtful project planning and a clear alignment to program objectives, SMEs across all provinces and territories can obtain substantial financial support to drive AI adoption – helping them become more productive, innovative, and competitive in the evolving digital economy.
