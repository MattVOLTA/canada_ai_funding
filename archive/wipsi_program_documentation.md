**❌ Vague Outcomes**
- Need specific, measurable outcomes
- "Better skills" is not enough - quantify improvement

**❌ Ineligible Training Provider**
- Ensure provider is qualified and reputable
- Get detailed quote and curriculum

**❌ Insufficient Financial Documentation**
- Need full 2 years of statements
- Must prove wage threshold

**❌ Missing Intake Window**
- Only 2 intakes per year (Oct and ~April)
- Miss deadline = wait 6 months
