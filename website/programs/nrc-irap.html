            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <p>The National Research Council Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP) is Canada's premier R&D support program for small and medium-sized enterprises. What sets IRAP apart is its advisor-led model: instead of submitting formal applications, businesses work directly with one of 250+ Industrial Technology Advisors (ITAs) who provide personalized guidance throughout the entire process.</p>

            <h3>Key Program Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advisor-Led Process:</strong> No formal application form - work directly with your assigned ITA to develop a fundable proposal</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Funding:</strong> From $50,000 for small projects to $10M for large, multi-year initiatives</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage Rates:</strong> Up to 80% of R&D salary costs and 50% of contractor/consulting costs</li>
                <li><strong>Technology-Agnostic:</strong> All sectors eligible - technology innovation is the focus, not sector</li>
                <li><strong>ITA Support:</strong> Your advisor provides technical feedback, advocates internally, and helps strengthen proposals</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
