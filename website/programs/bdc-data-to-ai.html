            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <p>The BDC Data to AI Program addresses the AI adoption gap for Canadian SMBs. Launched December 4, 2024, this program provides a unique "advisory + financing" bundle that helps established businesses identify, plan, and implement AI solutions without requiring upfront capital.</p>

            <h3>Why This Program Exists:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only 8% of Canadian SMBs have adopted AI (vs. 29% in the U.S.)</li>
                <li>SMBs lack internal expertise to evaluate vendors and integrate AI</li>
                <li>AI adoption requires upfront capital many SMBs can't self-finance</li>
                <li>Canada Digital Adoption Program (CDAP) ended March 31, 2025, creating a funding gap</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You Get:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Readiness Assessment:</strong> Current state analysis and capability gaps identification</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity Identification:</strong> High-impact AI use cases prioritized by ROI</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Selection:</strong> Vendor evaluation and recommendations</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Planning:</strong> Detailed roadmap with milestones and risk mitigation</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> Cost breakdown and ROI projections</li>
                <li><strong>Term Loan Financing:</strong> 100% project cost coverage with repayment up to 8 years</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>100% Coverage:</strong> Can finance full project cost, unlike programs with 50-75% matching</li>
                <li><strong>8-Year Repayment:</strong> Longer than commercial banks (eases cash flow)</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Government Assistance:</strong> Loan doesn't count toward government assistance caps - can stack with grants</li>
