- **Source A** (Some news articles): "Announcements to follow in March 2026"
- **Source B** (Early reports): "Announcements in early 2026"
- **Assessment:** March 2026 is the correct, specific timeframe based on the official website language
- **Resolution:** March 2026 is more precise and from official sources
- **Confidence in Resolution:** 90/100

**No other major conflicts identified.** Information is remarkably consistent across sources, likely because:
1. Program is new with single official announcement
2. All sources drawing from same G7 Summit statement
3. Operational details not yet released, so nothing to conflict about

### Information Gaps

**Critical Gaps (Prevent Full Assessment):**

1. **Contact Information**
   - **Impact:** Potential applicants cannot ask questions or get clarifications before launch
   - **Where to Look:** Check official website after November 1, 2025; likely will be published closer to launch
   - **Who to Ask:** Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) via official website form

2. **Application Requirements**
   - **Impact:** Cannot prepare detailed submission in advance
   - **Where to Look:** Will be announced November 17, 2025 on official website
   - **Resolution:** This is by design - information will be available when competition starts

**Important Gaps (Reduce Confidence):**

1. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - **Impact:** Don't know exactly what judges will prioritize
   - **Where to Look:** Will be announced with challenges on November 17, 2025

2. **The Four Specific Challenges**
   - **Impact:** Cannot start solution development yet
   - **Where to Look:** Will be revealed November 17, 2025

3. **Submission Format and Requirements**
   - **Impact:** Unknown what deliverables are needed (written proposal? Prototype? Pitch deck? Code?)
   - **Where to Look:** Will be specified November 17, 2025

4. **Repayment Terms Clarity**
   - **Impact:** Minor - likely non-repayable but not 100% explicit
   - **Where to Look:** Should be clarified in challenge announcement or application guidelines

5. **Eligible Expenses**
   - **Impact:** Unknown what the $10,000 can be used for
   - **Where to Look:** Will likely be specified in challenge announcement

6. **Number of Awards**
   - **Impact:** Don't know exact number of winners (only that total pool is $100K and individual awards up to $10K)
   - **Where to Look:** May be announced November 17 or kept flexible based on submission quality

7. **Post-Award Deployment Process**
   - **Impact:** Unclear how "potential deployment" works - is it guaranteed for winners? What's the timeline?
   - **Where to Look:** Likely will be discussed in March 2026 with winners

**Nice-to-Have Gaps (Non-Critical):**

1. **Past successful patterns** - N/A, first-time program
2. **Typical approval rates** - N/A, first-time program
3. **Participant testimonials** - N/A, first-time program
4. **Regional success patterns** - N/A, international program not yet run

### Manual Action Items

**Required Manual Steps:**

1. **Monitor official website starting November 1, 2025**
   - URL: https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/ai-grand-challenge.html
   - Check weekly for updated contact information or pre-launch guidance
   - Sign up for email alerts if available

2. **Check website on November 17, 2025 (Launch Day)**
   - Download all challenge descriptions immediately
   - Review submission requirements for chosen challenge
   - Note any info sessions or support resources announced
   - Verify contact information for questions during competition

3. **Verify repayment terms** when challenge details published
   - Confirm whether $10,000 awards are non-repayable
   - Check for any conditions on funding (milestone-based, etc.)
   - Understand IP and open-source requirements for GAIN catalogue

4. **Bookmark these resources for future updates:**
   - G7 Canada 2025 website: https://g7.canada.ca/
   - Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Responsible AI page: https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai.html

## Research Metadata

**Research Completed:** 2025-10-30
**Research Duration:** 45 minutes
**Iteration Count:** 1 round (comprehensive initial research; additional rounds not needed given appropriate TBA gaps)
**Final Completeness Score:** 65/100
**Final Quality Score:** 80/100
**Ready for JSON Integration:** Yes, with caveats noted in "Recommended Next Steps - For Database Integration"

**Researcher Notes:**

This is a well-documented program for its stage (pre-launch), with clear official sources and consistent information across all channels. The moderate completeness score (65%) reflects appropriate information gaps for a program that hasn't launched yet, rather than poor research quality.

Key factors affecting completeness:
- Program launches November 17, 2025 (18 days from research date)
- Four specific challenges intentionally not yet revealed
- Application process details by design not available until launch
- Contact information typical for pre-launch phase (website only)

**Strengths of this research:**
- Multiple authoritative sources corroborate all key facts
- Clear timeline and structure extracted
- Strong policy context from official G7 documents
- No contradictory information found across 15+ sources

**Limitations acknowledged:**
- Cannot assess actual application difficulty until challenges revealed
- Cannot provide examples (program hasn't run)
- Cannot offer success patterns (first-time program)
- Contact information limited (expected for pre-launch)

**Recommended re-research date:** November 18, 2025 (day after challenges announced) to capture:
- Four specific challenges
- Detailed submission requirements
- Evaluation criteria
- Contact information for competition support
- Any updates to funding structure or eligibility

**Strategic assessment:** This is a unique opportunity for international recognition with relatively low funding but high prestige. Best suited for those who can commit to intensive 2-week sprint and value public sector impact over commercial returns. Given international G7 scope, expect very competitive selection (likely <5% acceptance rate).
